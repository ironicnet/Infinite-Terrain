It's an infinite terrain generator. Using a simplex noise algorithm I created an infinite terrain that just keeps on going no matter how much you move

You can adjust the height and detail values but obviously due to the random nature. Controlling it much more than this is pretty tough. Anyway I've uploaded the web player so you can see if this is something that would be useful before commiting to the epic 300kb download ;)

Enjoy!
